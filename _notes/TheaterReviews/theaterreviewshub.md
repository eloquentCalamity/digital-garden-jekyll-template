title: Theater Reviews
---

I love theater. It's been part of my life for a very long time, starting when my sister did theater in 3rd grade followed by me starting theater the next year. I've performed in a variety of plays, done tech work for a show, done a professional Shakespeare show, and was a background character in a musical. (I didn't like musicals for a while.) Anyways, I still love theater and try to act and watch shows whenever possible, so here are my reviews of the shows I've seen recently. I'm not egotistical enough to review the shows I was in.

[Waiting for Lefty](https://rosemarysprigs.netlify.app/waitingforlefty) - 9/10, a strong showing from OU Theater of a controversial play about an equally contentious topic.
