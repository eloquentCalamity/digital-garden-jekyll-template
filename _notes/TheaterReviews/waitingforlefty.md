As always, spoilers below.  

Waiting for Lefty has an interesting history, both at OU and within the wider public sphere. The show is based on a 1934 cab driver strike, and caused a massive outcry at the time of release due to its pro-union messaging in a time where communism was still on the chopping block. According to the University Theater, it was going to be put on at the University decades ago, but was cancelled due to the highly politicized nature. This is its comeback to the school after the initial cancellation - and honestly, it's a pretty brilliant return.    

The show takes place during a union meeting, where a group of cab drivers are waiting for a man named Lefty to show up so that they vote to initiate a strike. Most of the characters are in favor despite the protests of a man named Harry Fatt, who's attempting to stop them from striking. The show then flashes through different scenes in the lives of the cab drivers and the people they love - the struggles they face due to low wages and the rising tensions in America related to the coming of the second world war. By the end of the show, it is revealed that Lefty is late because he was murdered. Despite Fatt's protest, the workers decide to strike, and sing a very moving song about it to close out the play.

OU's setting, props, and costuming were fantastic. Most of the seating was on the ground at the same level of the stage, which sold the feeling that we were in the meeting too - this is just as much our struggle as theirs. The walls were covered in pro-union materials, and the main stage was surrounded by chairs that marked the audience from the stage. The acting was equally high quality, but the standouts to me were Florence and Sid, who sold the emotion and drama of their love fantastically. The ending song, as I mentioned earlier, was very moving. It included pictures in the background of various noteworthy protests and strikes from the past hundred years, and it made the show feel authentic. This isn't just a theater production, this is a genuine call to action from the cast and director. In my opinion, this is the primary way that this play needs to be done. Anything else is disrespecting the intentions of the play, and OU has respected it to the highest possible degree. I loved this show, and it sold me on OU's theater team.
