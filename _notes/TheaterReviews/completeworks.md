As always, spoilers below.  

I love a good Shakespeare, as one might assume. I also love the work that Oklahoma Shakespeare in the Park does - their shows are phenomenally well-put together, and very unique. So when I learned that students get free tickets, I was gleeful that I had an excuse to go to every show of theirs that I was in town for, starting with this one. It was directed by the same man who played King Claudius when I went to see Hamlet, who sat next to me. He was very nice and absolutely had a great sense of humor, which showed through in the show. No pun intended.  

TCWOWS(A)(R)(A) (God that looks weird in text form. No going back now, I guess.) is not simply absolutely fucking hilarious, but also an impressive work of theater from an artistic perspective. It embodies the idea of the temporality of theater in that it includes a large aspect of improv and adaptation to the times, making each performance genuinely unique. The planned jokes are fantastic too - the goofy redo of Romeo and Juliet, the histories being played as a football game, the comedies all being mixed into one under the excuse that "they all have the same plot". It's a riot, and the three performers that were in this show sold it like crazy. I always adore shows that really utilize physicality, so the incessant flailing, tripping, and paper-mache vomiting that steps things up a notch. The costumes and sets were plain and generic, which lent heavily to the show's comedy.  

I've knocked it a few points for a couple off-color jokes that I personally didn't like too much, like some jokes about Juliet's actor having dubious consent for intimacy scenes and a poor sterotype of a Jewish person with anything involving Shylock. Otherwise, the show is a blast, and though it won't be running again with this particular cast, I suggest seeking out another one to give the show's magic a go.
