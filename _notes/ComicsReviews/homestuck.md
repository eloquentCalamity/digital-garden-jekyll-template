As always, spoilers ahead - as much as one can spoil Homestuck.  

A young person sits in their bedroom. It just so happens that today, the 27th of April, 2025, they will be finally writing a review of Homestuck for their small website. What will they say?  

Classic cheesy parody intro aside, there is no logical reason for me to have read this. I was never a part of the fandom (I was 4 when it started and 11 when it ended, so yeah.), I never really had any friends who were either, and I was only familiar with it to the extent that one knows about the Trolls from the widespread popularity they garnered. So as with most things I consume outside of my sphere, one night I just said "fuck it" and decided to read the thing in like 2-3 weeks. It's... an experience. That's for sure. It's something that I'm not sure I can even give a rating, because it's just so varied and chaotic and incomprehensible at times. At this point, I think I'll just go over what I did and didn't like. Reader discretion is advised - I will not be providing anything close to an explanation for anyone who has not read Homestuck before, because that would take an eternity and probably kill me before I finished it.  

Firstly, I want it known to the universe that I hate the Beta kids and I don't think they needed to exist. The individual kids (mostly Roxy and Dirk) are fine, but the concept of them just gums up the comic in a really awful way. Just give the trolls more development, goddamn it. I know one of my friends would be really happy to see that, and so would I. Also, the epilogues are fan content, and they don't exist, and they can't hurt me. 

Anyways, I think that the comic has some really creative worldbuilding that I wish was more expounded on. I want to know more about how classpects work, mostly. But many of the other big concepts like first guardians, multiple universes, the felts/exiles, all of it is really fascinating and was one of my favorite parts of the comic. It also (usually... I'm looking at you, various slurs and really outdated jokes about gay people) had a good sense of humor, my two standout favorites being the "You can't keep down the clown" bit with Caliborn and Hussie and Jake's old-timey exclamations taking up most of the page right before Game Over. The art is well-done, mostly when the contributors come in and especially the work of Shelby Cragg, who has a gorgeous art style. Plus, the felt/midnight crew's entire existence. Those guys are fucking amazing and I want to high five Spades Slick.  

In terms of things I don't like, aside from the aforementioned beta kids/epilogues/slurs, the little game sections are kind of boring, and the comic has a tendency to drag at a lot of places, which for a comic this long is painful. There's probably more that I dislike, but I can't think of it right now. Maybe I'll update this later, if I remember anything else I don't like. Final verdict, a Holy Toledo out of Fish Puns.
