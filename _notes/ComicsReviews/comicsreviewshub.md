I've had a pretty intense love of comics ever since I was a kid. One of my defining childhood memories was going to the comic store with my dad. He would get the newest New 52 Flash comic, while I would read Superman Family Adventures. I eventually was given my dad's childhood comics collection, and I devoured the New Mutants comics he had. I was a huge Spider-Man fan throughout my teenage years, and have since developed an affection for Batman comics and smaller independent comics. As with a lot of other stuff I enjoy, I want to talk about it here.

[The Last Ronin](https://rosemarysprigs.netlify.app/lastroninreview) - 8/10, a strong story I really enjoyed despite being a relative outsider to the TMNT canon.  

[Tokyo Ghoul](https://rosemarysprigs.netlify.app/tokyoghoul) - 8/10, a really cool manga with great worldbuilding and an excellent sense of depth.
