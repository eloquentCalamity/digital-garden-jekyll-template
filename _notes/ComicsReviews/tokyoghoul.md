As always, spoilers ahead.

I'm not usually much of a manga reader, so this one is kind of out of my wheelhouse. I only really picked it up because Dead by Daylight, one of my favorite games, recently adapted the main character Ken Kaneki into the game as a killer. The premise has also intrigued me enough in the past to where I vaguely remember reading a few chapters in before quitting. So, I decided to give it a go, and I'm very glad I did.  

Firstly, I want to state up front that I enjoy the art and character design, but that the battle scenes felt a little weird. Due to how fast the ghouls move, I felt like it couldn't really capture that movement quite well in the panels as well as I wanted to. However, like I said, the character design is great. My favorite designs are Juuzou (who is also one of my favorite characters overall - more on that later) and the different Arata, which look fantastically cool.    

However, the biggest lauds that I have to give to Tokyo Ghoul are the world-building and character work. I'm always a sucker for cool magic-y fantasy systems, so the way Ghouls work with their kagune and the creation of kakaju and all of that was super cool to me. But the real way it shines is creating a really strong morally grey world out of something that should be very black and white. Ghouls eat humans, so they should be the instinctive bad guys, right? There are indeed cruel and torturous ghouls who eat humans and inflict the worst sadistic tendencies upon others, but there are also pacifistic ghouls who want to avoid eating people and who hate fighting. Some of the CCG fight out of a genuine desire to make the world better and defeat evil ghouls, but there is a genocidal overtone to their goals that lays all ghouls out as violent and worthy of death because of their inherent nature. What should be a good versus evil conflict is broken down elegantly in order to allow the reader to dissect the actions and beliefs of individual characters. That's not to say all of them are morally neutral - Yamori is an absolute bastard, and Mado (the original one, not his daughter) is kind of a selfish weirdo himself, but many of the core characters have a lot of depth in what could be something very simple. I'm glad that I gave this a chance and I'm excited to be going through Tokyo Ghoul:re soon.
