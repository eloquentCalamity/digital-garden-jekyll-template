As always, spoilers ahead.  

I read The Last Ronin shortly after my favorite board game, Unmatched, launched its Kickstarter for a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles expansion. I was never really into the turtles as a kid, although I did dress up as Michelangelo for one Halloween (if I recall correctly). As with most products Unmatched collaborates with, I began to engage with some of the media related to the turtles. I had heard a lot of good things about The Last Ronin, and decided to give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised by how awesome it was, for lack of a better word. The art style is striking and crisp, and lends a lot to the story. It turns what could have been a goofy attempt at seriousness (like many more serious turtle adaptations have fallen into - looking at you, 2014 movie) into a well-realized depiction of the characters.  

Speaking of characters, the story was really intense even for someone who isn't as invested into the turtles. I appreciate that they went one-by-one, in ways that complemented their characters well. Raphael was brought down by his anger, one of his defining traits. Leonardo is blown up attempting to lead his team to victory, pushing himself past his limits to ensure the survival of others. Donatello goes out fighting side-by-side with his master. Mikey being the last one is heartbreaking. It's been discussed to death and back, but having the otherwise bright and boisterous Michelangelo haunted by the visions of his brothers is terrifying. I also want to give a shoutout the final battle between Mikey and Hiroto, which is a really well-executed long-form battle. It really sells the idea that this is a final battle, with both pulling out all the stops they possibly can.  

Overall, it's a pretty bang-up story. It's only knocked a couple of points because I think switching Leonardo and Donatello's ways of dying would have made a bit more sense, and I'm not the biggest fan of the epilogue-esque ending implying that new turtles are coming around. I feel like it removes some of the impact of Mikey's death - he won't be the final of his clan anymore, and the war will continue. I liked it a lot either way though, and might read some more TMNT comics.
