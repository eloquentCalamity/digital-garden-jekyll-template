Tribal decks are fun, so why not play all of the tribes at once?? I came up with this idea late at night right near the start of my journey making decks at all, so it's a lot jankier than many of my other decks. I'm still happy with it anyways - happy enough, at least.  

Let's start out with our commander: [Moritte of the Frost](https://scryfall.com/card/khm/223/moritte-of-the-frost). She's generally a pretty unnoteworthy Kaldheim uncommon - 6 mana for a changeling that enters the battlefield as any other permanent you control. For our purposes, we only care about her entering as a creature, in which she gets two +1/+1 counters and keeps her changeling ability. The plan before she enters is pretty simple: drop some anthem effects and a bit of protection onto the field, then once she enters let her wallop with commander damage.  

This leads to a weird, janky deck - fun, but weird and janky. There's some counter synergy with cards like [Hardened Scales](https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/243/hardened-scales), some ring-bearer cards because they give cheap draw and removal, and aura-focused protection package centered around some of the different Umbra cards that her color identity grants. Overall, will it actually function well? No. Will you be running a tribal tribal deck, though? Absolutely.
