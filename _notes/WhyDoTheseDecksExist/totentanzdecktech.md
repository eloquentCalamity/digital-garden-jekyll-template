_He's the giant rat that makes all of the rules._  

So I make a lot of _Magic the Gathering_ decks. Probably too many, to be honest. That's not my issue though. It's everybody else's, because I'm going to talk about them extensively. I want to start with the first deck I really made an effort to make. As an important piece of context, my partner loves rats. Whenever I get a new Magic card with a rat on it, it goes to them first. So I told them I would make a rat-themed deck. When I opened a pack of _Wilds of Eldraine_ one day and saw [Totentanz, Swarm Piper](https://scryfall.com/card/woe/216/totentanz-swarm-piper), I knew he had to lead these rats.  

Totentanz provides an interesting opportunity to subvert the traditional rats deck. Most are focused on a usual tribal approach - build up a large board, anthem them or provide some other major buff, then swing in with more creatures then an opponent knows what to do with. However, while Totentanz could lead a mediocre version of that, his first ability stood out to me a lot more. Basically, when a creature dies, you get a second creature. From there, I saw a lot of opportunities. My shot at this missed the mark pretty hard. It didn't really have many rats (granted, neither does the modern version, but we'll get there) and it could barely get anything out at the same pace other decks could. I scrapped it entirely and went back to the drawing board from there.  

I had thought for a while about using the deck as a burn deck, but it had been more of a convoluted side theme rather than a main focus. With the new version, I wanted it to be the entire plan. From there, a loop developed. Turn 1, the goal is to get a free sac outlet on the field. Turn 2 wants to get a "ping machine", or something that will start burning the opponents. Turn 3 wants Totentanz on the field, and then Turn 4 wants to start pumping out zero and one-drop creatures and sacrificing them, getting death triggers and doubling ETB triggers with Totentanz. The deck has a few other features - a couple of finishers in [Ojer Axonil](https://scryfall.com/card/lci/158/ojer-axonil-deepest-might-temple-of-power) that the draw and cycling that this deck has can locate, a back-up plan in a couple cards that reward using a swarm of rats in a more traditional tribal deck, and a low-to-the-ground mana curve that means that no main game plan card costs more than 4 mana.  

Overall, I'm pretty happy with the deck. As with most of my decks, it's been brewed before it's been able to be playtested. You can see the monstrous horde of aristo-rats that I've decided to unleash [here](https://archidekt.com/decks/11265155/rats_were_rats_were_the_rats_new).
