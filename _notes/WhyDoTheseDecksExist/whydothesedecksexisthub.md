title: Why Do These Decks Exist
---

I make an excessive number of Magic the Gathering decks. Probably too many, actually. Here's all of the ones I've added to the site so far.  

[Rats, We're Rats, We're the Rats](https://effortless-rabanadas-7ca1db.netlify.app/totentanzdecktech) - Overwhelm your opponents with an excess of aristocratic rats, with Totentanz leading the charge to turn _everything_ into rats.

[Tribal Tribal](https://effortless-rabanadas-7ca1db.netlify.app/tribaltribaldecktech) - One of my pet bracket one decks, where the goal is to drop a bunch of anthem effects onto the board, then drop Moriette of the Frost in order to capitalize on being a changeling.
