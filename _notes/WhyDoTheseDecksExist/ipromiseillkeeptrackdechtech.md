_Honestly, he's the most boring part of the deck._

I love digging through the bulk bin at my local game store. Everything in there is free, and people often leave behind cards that they think are useless that I find interesting or exciting. Case in point, I often find marker cards in the bins. Marker cards, for the unfamiliar, are cards meant to keep track of specific game mechanics - whether it's day or night, who's the monarch, which cards you've plotted, etc. I eventually got enough that I began to wonder - could I make a deck that used all of these cards? Thus, another one of my pet Bracket 1 decks, and a tie for one of my favorites, the all-markers deck. Hopefully, it's going to be part of a trilogy. More on that later.  

Two major problems presented themselves immediately. The first and most pressing of those being the existence of a Companion marker card. I had to somehow fit a whole companion into this deck. Companions are a nightmare to build around in the best of scenarios, but in a pressure cooker of random bullshit like this? Absolutely unfathomable. After fiddling around a bit with various commanders and companions, I decided to try and settle on a potential companion first. [Lutri, the Spellchaser](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/227/lutri-the-spellchaser) was of course immediately out, due to being banned in commander, as was [Yorion, Sky Nomad](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/232/yorion-sky-nomad), who cannot legally be played. [Kaheera, the Orphanguard](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/224/kaheera-the-orphanguard) was out due to the lack of viable creatures. I also discounted [Keruga, the Macrosage](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/225/keruga-the-macrosage) because I didn't like his requirements - same for [Luruss of the Dream-Den](https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/5/a/5ad36fb2-c44e-4085-ba0d-54277841ad3a.jpg?1682228556), but also because he presented too few options to the deck. From here, it went down to personal preference. For a long time, [Zirda, the Dawnwalker](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/233/zirda-the-dawnwaker) was my leading choice, but eventually I came back to one I had initially moved past: [Umori, the Collector](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/231/umori-the-collector). Its requirement of all cards of one type - that being creatures, due to having a commander - seemed insurmountable at first, but the more I thought about it the more reasonable it seemed. I decided to go with it, and found a commander that I thought would help support the deck (while providing a sufficent vessel, no pun intended, for the deck) - [Xavier Sal, Infested Captain](https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/14/xavier-sal-infested-captain). Populating and Proliferating is helpful for increasing the many random counters we have lying around from this deck. From there, I got to work on everything else.  

In the end, I managed to make it work. The saving grace of this deck, and the one reason why Umori is viable in any way shape or form, is Adventures. The body it's attatched to is a creature, so it counts for the deckbuilding requirements. However, it also provides us with draw, removal, and extra utility all around. It also packs some great supporting creatures like [Doc Aurlock, Grizzled Genius](https://scryfall.com/card/otj/201/doc-aurlock-grizzled-genius) (who was, by the way, an early contender for a commander before I had picked out Umori as my companion) to provide us with value for adventures, plotted cards, and foretell cards. Overall, I'm proud of the insurmountable amount of chaos this deck creates.
