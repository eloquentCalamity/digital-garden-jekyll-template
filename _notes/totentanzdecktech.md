title: Deck Tech - Rats, We're Rats, We're the Rats
---

So I make a lot of _Magic the Gathering_ decks. Probably too many, to be honest. That's not my issue though. It's everybody else's, because I'm going to talk about them extensively. I want to start with the first deck I really made an effort to make. As an important piece of context, my partner loves rats. Whenever I get a new Magic card with a rat on it, it goes to them first. So I told them I would make a rat-themed deck. When I opened a pack of _Wilds of Eldraine_ one day and saw Totentanz, Swarm Piper, I knew I had to build him.
