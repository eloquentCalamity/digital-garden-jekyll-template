title: Law and the Internet (Work in Progress).
---

I have very complicated feelings about the law, inspired mostly by my recent rubbings up against it. Paraphrasing what an officer once told me, "The law is great when it works for you and sucks when it doesn't." But that's the issue - it doesn't really work for anybody small. The thing I want to focus on here primarily is how it fails fundamentally in the age of the internet. This is more of an op-ed right now than anything, but I might end up making this a full video, because I think this meshes really well with my [Social Media, The Out Group, and the Dispersion of Surveillance](https://rosemarysprigs.netlify.app/surveillance) article from a while back. You could almost call this a continuation of that concept.
