This write-up is going to be a bit different than my usual. Tonight, I want to talk about identity and perception. I have no fancy preludes - this is a personal one.  

I started asking questions about my gender in high school. When I was a freshman, a person really close to me came out to me. Before that moment, I had no idea what being LGBTQ was. I hadn't even heard about the concept of being gay, to be honest. For the next few days, I used my Nintendo 3DS browser (out of fear of being discovered if I used anything else) to research what that person had told me, so that I could support them. This was my first dive into these ideas, and as I began to read through them I made a connection with some of the terms. I had never heard the term transgender, either. When I saw it and began to think about it, it began to make some form of sense to me. Thinking about it tore me apart.
