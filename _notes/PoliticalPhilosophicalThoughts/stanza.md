title: My Favorite Stanza of Poetry Ever
---

"And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!  
Smoothed by long fingers,  
Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,  
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.  
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,  
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?  
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,  
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,  
I am no prophet — and here’s no great matter;  
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,  
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,  
And in short, I was afraid."  
		- The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock  

The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock was recommended to me the summer before my junior year by a mentor of mine at a summer program that I attended, and I fell in love (no pun intended) as soon as I read it. It's a brilliant piece that captures the full breadth of human experience succinctly and beautifully. The rebellion of youth, the exhaustion of age, the acceptance at the end of life. It's a tearful and moving piece, but there is one part (captured above) that really slices through the rest of the poem and captivates me in a way few other stanzas ever have. I wanted to write about it, because it's had a huge impact on the way I write and think about poetry.  

The start is peaceful and calm, evoking the imagery of a lazy day at home with your pets. Throughout this poem, important concepts such as time and the "yellow fog" (itself most likely representational of either obligation or life outside the personal domicile) being depicted as having cat-like behaviors. This is a departure from the previous aspects of the poem, mostly because of how this stanza is transitory in nature. It is a vital crux between the rebellious and hedonistic exploration of youth which dominates the first half and the anger/eventual settle into peaceful acceptance of life that characterizes the latter half of this poem. Juxtaposing this is a part of the poem's expert mastery of tempo; In the earlier parts of the poem, the swing is between exploration and contemplation, the main character discussing his exploits and the time he has at one point, with his thoughts on the weariness of his lifestyle at the next. In the second half, it balances the rage against the concept of time versus the more peaceful meditation that shows the speaker's fall into relaxed old age. It is a masterful balance, and this stanza marks the transition between these two.  

As the stanza continues, the speaker starts to spiral into existential despair. The concept of eternal time that the speaker has previously lauded is beginning to crash down on him. His domesticity (tea and cakes and ices) is forcefully brought away by a crisis; potentially, a midlife crisis that forces him to contemplate the issues that weight heavy on the rest of the poem. He fights against this crumbling of youth - weeping and fasting, and praying, and attempting to revive those youthful flings with a callback to an earlier line (Time to turn back and descend the stair, with a bald spot in the middle of my hair). No matter what he tries, he must face the difficulties of age.  

These last four lines are what transition this from simply an expert transition into my favorite stanza, though. This is the great moment of his crisis - Death is coming and does not care about the speaker. "And in short, I was afraid." I have always regarded poetry as a way to abstract thought and emotion, to turn the indescribable emotions of life into depictions that reach; a job of translating, similar to the old concept of saying things in different ways to help someone else understand it. This final line breaks that entirely. There are no fancy words that can back you out of the corner of these emotions. He has exhausted all else, and there is nothing left but to say he is afraid. And it works - his lack of prose and pomp and anything but the visceral, simple description of "I am afraid", the simple human concept itself, does more than any amount of words could do. I have a bad habit of getting very, very verbose with my poems. I abstract as far as I can sometimes, distancing myself from the difficulty of those feelings just as much as I am translating them into words for those around me to understand. It is a reminder to breathe, and step back, and let emotion speak for itself when necessary. A reader may not understand what has occurred to make me write a poem, but emotions are our shared experiences, and sometimes it is important to let that shine through in a poem.
