title: Political & Philosophical Thoughts
---

This is a gathering place for my thoughts and ideas regarding politics, philosophy, etc. - basically the more serious stuff.

[Social Media, The Out Group, and the Dispersion of Surveillance](https://rosemarysprigs.netlify.app/surveillance) - A piece about the idea that social media has given the powers of the surveillance state to the people, discussed through the lens of the recent student visa revocations.

[Hope and the Burden of a Heart](https://rosemarysprigs.netlify.app/heavyburden) - A piece about staying hopeful and finding comfort despite the despair and difficulties that the world is throwing at us, combined with a touch of Howl's Moving Castle.
