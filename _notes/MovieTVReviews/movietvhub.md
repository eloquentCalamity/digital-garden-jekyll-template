I am a fan of stories in all mediums, so of course TV and movies appeal to me. They have a unique ability to capture things visually that written mediums do not, and the ability to more carefully narrow a view and streamline a story than a game can. So I take lots of suggestions and am trying to punch through the list when possible. Below are the ones I've watched recently.  

[Willy's Wonderland](https://rosemarysprigs.netlify.app/wilyswonderland) - 10/10, a cheesy Cage movie with a stupid premise that I absolutely adore for some reason.
