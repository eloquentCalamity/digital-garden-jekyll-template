God do I love this movie. I know this is in theory along the lines of the b-movies you'd pick up at the dollar store out of curiosity (and it probably is), but it's still one of my favorite movies ever. I was big into Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) as a kid, whispering playground rumors about how the first three games worked and what the lore was. This does not capture that feeling, but it still satisfies my love of wacky murder animatronics.  

The premise itself is quite curious - a small town that traps random people in order to appease a bunch of murder robots. It's an interesting enough spin on the classic FNAF formula to pop out at you, but the real standout is Nic Cage's character, who doesn't really have a name but who I've often seen referred to as The Janitor. He's simple in theory and in practice: a silent desperado who drinks soda and loves arcade games. The reason the character is so funny though is because not once in the entire movie does that character concept break in any way. The man takes routine breaks as a part of his restaurant cleaning duties, and he will leave mid-fight to take his break. He will drink that soda. He will play his arcade game. He will clean the building even if the animatronics try to break it. The man fistfights these animatronics not simply because they are trying to kill him but because it's his job to clean the place, and _they are in his way_. It's simple but brilliant, and it makes me laugh every time, because the execution is fantastic.  

The other part I like is the absolute hammering that Cage brings to the animatronics. The fight scene choreography is pretty well executed, and the ways that they occur are all very unique and differentiated from one another, making it a little more unpredictable and interesting. The supporting cast works well, and the plot is alright, but this and Cage's performance are the two real standout moments and the reason I'm happy to rewatch this movie whenever.
