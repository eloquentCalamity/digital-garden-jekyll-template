As always, spoilers below.  

There's not really a time period of history I love more than the span between 1896 (The Chicago World Fair) and about 1970 (The Cold War and the Civil Rights Movement). I think that so much fascinating material is contained within this time period across the globe, the implications of which are still incredibly defining factors in the way the world works. Within this time period is a renaissance of science in many ways, especially in the physics world. Very few figures represent this better than Niels Bohr, who paved the way for basically everything modern physics does through his work on how the atom works among many others. In 1941, there was a visit between Niels and another physicist named Werner Heisenberg that is still mostly unexplained in its reasoning, especially regarding a walk the two took in the late evening. This meeting is the entire setting for the play, and exploring the reasons its motive.  

Firstly, the conceit is fantastic, and the main way it's staged is also pretty spectacular. The stage is mostly bare except for a few chairs, which complements the fact that the entire show is only three characters. It's representative of the play's efforts to strip these men down to their bare bones, to try and really dig into both of their psyches and explore their histories. Suffice it to say, it does a fantastic job. The two feel like they're not just trying to convey to us who they are, but to each other. The rift that opened in their relationship due to the war is being investigated and picked apart, and it's a brilliant way to do it.  

My only real gripe with the play is the third character, Bohr's wife. I recognize that her role in the functioning of the play is important - a third perspective to bounce off of, to break up the scenes and provide more depth - but I don't think she's as well integrated into the existence of the play as she could be. Her presence is used less than it could be and is biased in a way I think determents the play a bit. Regardless, this play is still incredible, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in science within theater.
