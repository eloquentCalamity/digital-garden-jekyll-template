As a future English teacher, I'm legally obligated to read as many books as humanly possible. Also, I just like doing it, and I have since I was I was a youngin. I'm  trying to diversify my reading as well, so expect a good diversity of stuff. I'm also putting written forms of plays here, for consistency's sake.

[Copenhagen](https://rosemarysprigs.netlify.app/copenhagen) - 8/10, an interesting play about physics and ethics that has fantastic character writing.
