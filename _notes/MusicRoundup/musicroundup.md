title: Music Roundups & Music in General
--- 

I thrive on music, especially when being contemplative or as background stuff for walks or games. So I keep very careful track of my music. My usual structure is that I have one master playlist named Gaia, where I have every song I've enjoyed since about 8th grade listed. From there, I have a playlist that's my current songs that I'm listening to which is recreated at three points during the year - End of spring semester, end of summer, and end of winter break. They're usually mythologically named, because I'm a sucker for that. Here I'll probably just write about the playlist I've had for that span of time, and what my favorite songs from that span of time were.

[Spring 2025 Roundup - Aphrodite](https://rosemarysprigs.netlify.app/aphrodite2025) - Made for my first semester at OU, with a wide variety of styles and genres.  

[My Favorite Albums of All Time](https://rosemarysprigs.netlify.app/albums) - A love letter to my favorite albums, because I personally don't see enough appreciation for full album experiences.
