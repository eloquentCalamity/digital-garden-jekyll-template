title: My Favorite Albums of All Time
---

My father often remarks that people nowadays miss the "album experience" of picking up a full album of music and just listening to it straight through to get the full picture of an artist's intent for the music in it. Therefore, in honor of him, I'd like to list out my favorite albums of all time, the ones that I have sat and listened to and been in awe of the full artistic vision of. I was originally intending to make this a short list of a few albums, but there are so many I love that I couldn't decide. I'll be ranking the top 10, and then listing all the albums below that unranked. The unranked albums are by no means bad - any album that's made it to this list at all is either something influential in my life or something I'd happily listen to repeatedly, especially considering I am often guilty of ignoring the full album experience.  

1. The Weatherman (Gregory Alan Isakov)  
When making this list, I immediately partitioned this off as the obvious choice for the top spot. No album soothes me or fills me with peace quite like The Weatherman. It's a gorgeous meditation about travelling through life and finding peace with its woes, sorrows, and realities. Every song is filled to the brim with emotion and conveys its message with mastery through Isakov's gentle, beautiful voice and his talent for simple but incredibly effective melodies. It's an album I never, ever get tired of, no matter how often I re-listen to it.  

2. Bankrupt! (Phoenix)  
As a child, my father often played songs from another Phoenix album, Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, which I rather enjoyed. After listening to that album in its entirety, I discovered Bankrupt!, and this was what really sold me on Phoenix. Their abstract lyricism is on display at its finest, with some of their catchiest beats in their entire discography and an amazing vaguely synth-wave aesthetic. Phoenix does an amazing job of capturing feeling without using perfectly specific lyrics, and this is perhaps their best display of that.  

3. A Rush of Blood to the Head (Coldplay)  
This album will always have a special place in my heart. Not only is it great 2000s alt rock, it's also the album that introduced me to music, in a sense. I had a vague sense of favorite songs and little things I liked, but hearing this album and its music for the first time from my father really made me aware of what music could be and how it could make you feel. Its themes of regret and yearning for being better resonated with me at the 11-13 age (that's a whole other story), and it just really touched me in general. Good music and good memories mean this album will always be here in the top 10.    

4. Mylo Xyloto (Coldplay)  
Coldplay has always been pretty influential in my life, ok? Mylo Xyloto holds its own as the first album I feel like I "discovered" on my own. I had heard a few songs from it as part of my rearing on Coldplay, but it was the first album I went out and listened to on my own. The storyline it presents was something I loved as a dystopian-obsessed tweenager/teenager, and the music's hopeful nature was also something I really needed. An album I found myself with the right message at the right time, almost like a strike of lightning at the right moment, is once again something that will always stay in my list of favorites.  

5. (self titled) (Marcus Mumford)  
(self titled) is a deeply personal album for Mumford, personal enough that the rest of Mumford and Sons recommended that he make it on his own. I found it due to my following of Mumford and Sons, and I'm so glad I did. Not only does it have Mumford's great mastery of both modern and classical rock instruments, it had a lot of messages that I needed to hear. Additionally, his tour for the album was my first chance to go to a concert on my own because I wanted to, and it was well worth it. (I managed to snag a front row standing seat, and it was amazing.)  

6. A Constant State of Ohio (Lincoln)  
This is technically an EP, but it's damn good enough to deserve a spot here. This is a brilliant EP from a really talented artist, most of this getting overlooked due to the explosive popularity of the EP's top track, Saint Bernard. I would argue that it's one of the weaker of the 5 songs, with the others being among some of my all-time favorite songs. They (along with Lincoln's other music) capture the feeling of youthful pushback against the world without falling into the common trope of youthful anger, which is a great distinction to find.  

7. Delta (Mumford and Sons)  
My original comfort album, in a sense. Though I had listened to many other Mumford and Sons songs before this, this was the first one I caught the release of, bought the CD of at its release, and really soaked in without checking out the songs online. My first "traditional" album experience, if you will. A gorgeous melancholic romp through big emotions regarding love and breakups and release, and one with many songs I still absolutely adore.  

8. Racine Carree (Stromae)
Square Root, if translated directly into English, is perhaps the most "left-field" of my albums so far. I heard some of Stromae's songs in my high-school French classes, and immediately went to listen to this album. It's a shame he's not well known in the west, because his music is full of both stinging commentary and quiet, gorgeous awe. I think _ave cesaria_ off this album is one of the best love songs I've ever heard. Also, fun fact I've heard before - the music video for _Quand c'est?_ partly inspired the appearance of The Entity in Dead by Daylight, apparently.  

9. Studio Killers (Studio Killers)  
Studio Killers are fucking phenomenal. Their discography could support a dance party of epic proportions all on its own. It's great hype music and fantastic to listen to if you're trying to get some extra energy. I found this midway through high school and it has been supporting my higher emotion moments ever since. We're getting to the point where the albums are moving towards "I really like this" rather than "It has sentimental meaning AND I really like this".

10. Hawaii: Part II (Musical Miracle)
One of my first introductions to experimental/weird music, and one that still has many songs that hold up. The enigma and mystery surrounding both the album's initial conception, its connection to Tally Hall, and its story/what it means are so cool, and really inspirational in terms of creating interesting and engaging art pieces.  

The Unranked But Still Loved Section:  

The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess (Chappell Roan) - My unofficial #11, and a strong contender to take a spot on the list. Me and my partner LOVE listening to Chappell, and her music is a great example of what pop can/should be.  

This Empty Northern Hemisphere (Gregory Alan Isakov) - Also a great listen from Isakov, and just as wonderfully moody as The Weatherman, but with a little less oomph in my mind.  

Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (Phoenix) - I mentioned it earlier, but this was another early introduction to albums from my dad, and it's still holding up well. There's just other albums I like more.  

Alpha Zulu (Phoneix) - Can you tell I really like their work? A newer album and one that holds up all the way through, which is a rarity for a full album. It also falls into the category of "amazing, but there are other albums that deserve the top spots more".  

AM (Arctic Monkeys) - An all-timer in terms of albums in general, and one that really stuck out to me in Freshman/Sophomore year. It definitely deserves its reputation, but it doesn't hold nearly the same sentimental weight to me.  

A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (Panic! At the Disco) - My introduction to anything regarding punk, but not something I'd relisten much to nowadays. It gets its spot here on sentimentality.  

Tourist History (Two Door Cinema Club) - The album has a great overall vibe, and a few of my favorite songs (Undercover Martin & What You Want), but not too much holding it in high regard in my mind otherwise.  

Who Really Cares (TV Girl) - TV Girl always has immaculate vibes, and they are another favorite of me and my partner. I love a lot of the individual songs from this album, but probably won't listen to it straight through again.  

Ever After (Marianas Trench) - A criminally underrated band, in my opinion. Their albums are great story tracks, and this one is no exception. They have so much personality, and this album has a lot of individual bangers alongside its pretty solid overarching narrative.
