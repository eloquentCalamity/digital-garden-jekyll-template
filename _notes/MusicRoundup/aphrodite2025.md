I figured that Aphrodite, the goddess of love and one of my personal favorites, would be a good name for a playlist made to represent a new start to things. Here's my 5 favorite songs off of it this semester:  

5. Maps by Yeah Yeah Yeahs - Not just a banger, but a great song to chill to. Its simplicity lends it a lot of strength as something to just put on and let flow over you.  

4. Bullet Holes by Gregory Alan Isakov - One of his newer songs, and one that really holds its own with his finest. Very soothing to the soul.  

3. Smokey Eyes by Banks - A song about college, but also just a great energizer from a great EP overshadowed by Saint Bernard.  

2. Houdini by Foster the People - Not only am I a huge fan of Harry Houdini, but my dad used to play Pumped Up Kicks for me a bunch as a kid. This is way better and has an enchanting rhythm.  

1. i'm low on gas and you need a jacket by Cavetown - I've been listening to this one on repeat since it came out. It's an incredible cover, and is somehow both calming and upbeat.  

Honorable Mention: Dance, Baby! by boy pablo - I gave it the honorable mention spot because it might be due to recency bias, but this is an incredibly danceable song and a new favorite of mine.  

Short List:  
Espresso by Sabrina Carpenter, bleach by vandalism, Love On The Outside by Wishy, Budapest by George Ezra, Red Wine Supernova by Chappell Roan, Achilles Come Down by Gang of Youths, Kilby Girl by The Backseat Lovers, archie, marry me by Alex Scalzo, fineshrine by Purity Ring, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel, Dear Maria, Count Me In by All-Time Low, Loverboy by A-Wall, Semi-Charmed Life by Third Eye Blind, Tripping Over Air by Aidan Bissett, and Banks by Lincoln.  

This summer's playlist will be Helios. Tune in this August for the roundup for that.
