Recently, I've been watching and thinking a lot about the idea of intentionality. It underlies a lot of my core beliefs, including the goodness that I think is inherent to the world and my desire to explore it. Unfortunately, especially in the modern era, that feels harder and harder. I struggle with it a lot, finding myself kind of absorbed into algorithms and numbed by the meaninglessness of scrolling. This is an attempt to focus my thoughts and efforts into something intentional. It's not something I intend to try and reach an audience - it's more of a screaming into the void sort of thing. If people see it, great. Either way, it's an effort to take control of my own thoughts.

I don't generally like the use of AI for a number of reasons. I'm not really here to debate it though, but there are resources (which I will eventually link below) about some of the reasons it's harmful. For me, though, I feel as if it takes away my creative expression and agency. I want to decide things for myself, and if it takes longer to learn and create because of that, good. Learning and creating is a key part of the human experience to me.
